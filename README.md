# Spotify-Top-Tracks-App
This program is open-source and reliable. It is easy to use. By using the "Client ID" and "Client Secret" information obtained from the Spotify Developer Portal, you can view the songs you’ve listened to the most on Spotify and create a playlist with a single click. You should specify how many songs you want in the "Limit" section. In the "Time Range" section, there are three different time intervals. The descriptions of these intervals are as follows:

short_term: Last 1 month,
medium_term: Last 6 months,
long_term: Last year

Run this command in the terminal to set up the Spotipy library:
pip install spotipy // Windows
pip3 install spotipy // MacOS

Happy listening!

NOTE: Some antivirus programs may give false-positive results for the exe file. The code is completely clean. If you want, you can scan the code using AI tools like ChatGPT.
The reasons for it being flagged as a virus include the fact that it was converted into an exe file using PyInstaller and the permissions requested by the Spotipy module from the Spotify API.
Please do your research and ensure that it’s clean before running the code.
