# Spotify-Top-Tracks-App
This program is open-source and reliable. It is easy to use. By using the "Client ID" and "Client Secret" information obtained from the Spotify Developer Portal, you can view the songs youâ€™ve listened to the most on Spotify and create a playlist with a single click. You should specify how many songs you want in the "Limit" section. In the "Time Range" section, there are three different time intervals. The descriptions of these intervals are as follows:

short_term: Last 1 month
medium_term: Last 6 months
long_term: All time

Happy listening!
